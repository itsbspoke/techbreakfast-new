      <p class="">
      <p>In addition to investing in and advising a growing number of technology startups, Garth runs business development for ScanBizCards, which has a wildly popular app that turns your smartphone into a business card reader and contact management solution.</p>
      <p>After 11 years of sales experience in the Bay Area, he had the perfect startup journey with Jigsaw.com.From 2 guys and a whiteboard to a $175MM exit in 2010 to Salesforce.com, he ran sales, business development, client support and the community.</p>
      <p>In 2011 he co-founded a social TV/ Second Screen company called OtherScreen in Charlotte that showed signs of success (won NC IDEA grant, created a buzz in the local TV market, had wildly happy users, raised VC money) before failing to gain significant traction and closing in November 2012.</p>
      <p>His goal with SBC is to boost the already impressive reach of the app and take part in a second exit as an investor AND an early executive. Then he will start another company in his hometown and hopefully spawn several other successful companies in the Charlotte area, while at the same time balancing the crazy great life that he lives outside work with his friends and family.</p>
