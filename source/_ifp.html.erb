        Two minutes, sounds easy, right?  Who can't talk for two minutes? <br/>
        It'll be the hardest two minutes of your month.  To summarize your company's value proposition in an interesting way
        is a challenge for many seasoned entrepreneurs.  But that's what IDEA Pitch asks you to do.  You won't regret having
        a quality elevator pitch, so why not commit to perfecting one?

      The experience of pitching at PitchBreakfast is focused on getting practice in front of our positive, supportive community.
      Our best pitchsters, however, will have bigger opportunities than making friends while drinking free juice.  Unlike PitchBreakfast, 
      if a presenter nails their pitch and the Q+A session to follow, the IDEA Fund Partners may bring you to Durham 
      to do your pitch for the assembled investment team.

      <h4>Dave Rizzo</h4>
      <p>
      Mr. David P. Rizzo, Dave, is the Managing Partner and Venture Partner at IDEA Fund Partners. He is the President and Chief Executive Officer at NC IDEA. Mr. Rizzo joined MCNC in June 2002 and became the President and Chief Executive Officer. At the firm, he created a new corporate strategy to stimulate economic development throughout North Carolina. As part of this strategy, he formed and led three MCNC companies created to better assist the transition of North Carolina's economy from basic manufacturing to a research-based, advanced manufacturing economy. Mr. Rizzo strategically realigned the company into three separate organizations to better focus its resources â€“ including the creation and leadership of MCNC Ventures. He also led the company through a restructuring that resulted in the spin-off of MCNC Research & Development Institute (now NC IDEA). Prior to joining MCNC, Mr. Rizzo was the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Osprey Systems, which he founded in Charlotte in 1992 and sold in 2002.
