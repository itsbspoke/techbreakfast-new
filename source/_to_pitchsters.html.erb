    	<p>Hi May Pitchsters,</p>
 
<p>As promised, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz6_qIYsC2utNHF6X1VJTU5zZDYtdEo3YTh5RlBVNVBIWWYw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> is the more formal event agenda and the pitch timeframe for Wednesday, May 14th.  Please call me at 704.341.5137 if you want to discuss further and I would welcome that. <a href="mailto:ahill@packardplace.us?Subject=TechBreakfast">Adam Hill</a>, Director at Packard Place, can help you load your PowerPoint/KeyNote program onto our venue presentation computer and we would ask that you have it ready and sent to us <strong> by no later than 5 pm on Monday, May 12th </strong>for loading. If you are emailing, please send to both me and Adam Hill only.</p>
 
<p>Day of event, please plan to arrive around <strong> 7:45 am </strong> for us to get you organized with the agenda line up and meet the panelists before we start.</p>

<p>Juan Garzón has a guideline for pitching that can be found <a href="http://garzonco.com/techbreakfastclt/">here.</a></p>
 
<p>We look forward to it! Thank you again for participating in this with us!</p>
