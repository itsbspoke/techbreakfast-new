    	<p>Hi December Pitchsters,</p>
 
<p>As promised, here is the more formal event agenda and the pitch timeframe (page 2) for Wednesday, December 11th .  Please call me at 704.341.5137 if you want to discuss further and I would welcome that. Adam Hill at Packard Place, who is copied here, can help you load your PowerPoint/KeyNote program onto our presentation computer at Packard Place and we would ask that you have it ready and sent to us <strong> by no later than 5 pm on Monday, December 9th 
</strong>for loading. If you are emailing, please send to both me and Adam Hill only.</p>
 
<p>Day of event, please plan to arrive around <strong> 7:45 am </strong> for us to get you organized with the agenda line up and meet the panelists before we start.</p>
 
<p>I will follow back up with you around December 3rd just to check in and see if you need anything prior to the event. This could be our best line up this year! Thank you again for participating in this with us! It will be fun!</p>
