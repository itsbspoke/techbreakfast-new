    	<p>Hi January Pitchsters,</p>
 
<p>As promised, here is the more formal event agenda and the pitch timeframe (page 2) for Wednesday, January 8th.  Please call me at 704.341.5137 if you want to discuss further and I would welcome that. Adam Hill at Packard Place, who is copied here, can help you load your PowerPoint/KeyNote program onto our presentation computer at Packard Place and we would ask that you have it ready and sent to us <strong> by no later than 5 pm on Monday, January 6th 
</strong>for loading. If you are emailing, please send to both me and Adam Hill only.</p>
 
<p>Day of event, please plan to arrive around <strong> 7:45 am </strong> for us to get you organized with the agenda line up and meet the panelists before we start.</p>
 
<p>I will follow back up with you around January 3rd just to check in and see if you need anything prior to the event. We look forward to our first event of 2014! Thank you again for participating in this with us! It will be fun!</p>
