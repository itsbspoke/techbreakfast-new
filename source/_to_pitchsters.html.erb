    	<p>Hi May Pitchsters,</p>
 
<p>As promised, here is the more formal event agenda and the pitch timeframe for Wednesday, May 14th.  Please call me at 704.341.5137 if you want to discuss further and I would welcome that. Adam Hill at Packard Place, who is copied here, can help you load your PowerPoint/KeyNote program onto our presentation computer at Packard Place and we would ask that you have it ready and sent to us <strong> by no later than 5 pm on Monday, May 5th </strong>for loading. If you are emailing, please send to both me and Adam Hill only.</p>
 
<p>Day of event, please plan to arrive around <strong> 7:45 am </strong> for us to get you organized with the agenda line up and meet the panelists before we start.</p>

<p>Juan Garz√≥n has a guideline for pitching that can be found <a href="http://garzonco.com/techbreakfastclt/">here.</a></p>
 
<p>We look forward to it! Thank you again for participating in this with us!</p>
