Please call me at 704.341.5137 if you want to discuss further and I would welcome that. <a href="mailto:ahill@packardplace.us?Subject=TechBreakfast">Adam Hill</a>, Director at Packard Place, can help you load your PowerPoint/KeyNote program onto our venue presentation computer and we would ask that you have it ready and sent to us <strong> by no later than 5 pm on Monday, June 9th </strong>for loading. If you are emailing, please send to both me and Adam Hill only.</p>
